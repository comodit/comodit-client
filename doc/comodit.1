.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
ComodIT is a global, integrated and centralized platform that eases the management of Linux systems and cloud provisioning (i\&.e\&. the instantiation of ready\-to\-use VMs)\&.
.PP
ComodIT actually manages different types of resources representing high\-level concepts:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.el \{\
.sp -1

environments: an environment is defined in the context of an organization\&. It represents a group of servers having common properties, access rights, etc\&. For example, it may be interesting to define a test environment containing servers used by developers to test their software and a production environment containing servers hosting the software accessed by customers\&.

flavors: a flavor is a template of distribution\&. Flavors are read\-only resources\&.
.RE
.PP
ComodIT client allows to handle ComodIT resources by interacting with ComodIT server through its REST API\&. Basically, a target resource type, an action and a resource identifier \-\-sometimes additional parameters\-\- have to be provided\&. The action is then applied on given resource\&.
.PP
Instead of a resource type, a service name can be given\&. Again, an action and some parameters may be provided, leading to one or several interactions with the server\&.
.PP
Some resources, so called sub\-resources, are \*(Aqincorporated\*(Aq into others i\&.e\&. they must be accessed through a containing resource\&. For example, the following sub\-resources are common to several resources:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
parameters: a value expected by an application, a distribution or a platform\&. This value is identified by a key\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
settings: a key\-value pair that may be associated to an organization, an environment, a host, as well as an application, a distribution or a platform associated to a given host\&. The key should match a parameter key and, therefore, provide an expected value\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
files: a file that may be associated to a distribution, a platform or an application\&.
.RE
.PP
When a sub\-resource must be targeted, its type is composed of the containing resource type and the sub\-resource\*(Aqs type\&. There may be several levels of resources\&.
.PP
Available (sub)resources and services are described in more details below\&.
.PP
Examples are given at the end of this page\&.
.SH "COMODIT RESOURCES"
.SS "Introduction"
.PP
Most resources feature exactly the same actions which share the same semantic:
.PP
list ID
.RS 4
Lists resources of given type associated to given resource (identified by ID)\&.
.RE
.PP
show ID [\-\-raw]
.RS 4
Prints informations about a resource on standard output\&. ID is a resource\*(Aqs identifier and depends on resource\*(Aqs type\&. \-\-raw option causes the client to print the JSON representation of the resource\&.
.RE
.PP
add [\-f FILE|\-\-file FILE|\-j JSON|\-\-json JSON] [ID]
.RS 4
Creates a new resource, potentially in the context of a containing resource whose ID must then be given\&. Without any option, a JSON template is opened with editor defined by environment variables VISUAL or EDITOR\&. If these variables are not defined, \*(Aqnotepad\&.exe\*(Aq is used on Windows and \*(Aqvi\*(Aq on other systems\&. If opened template is saved, a new resource is created using provided data\&.
.sp
If \*(Aq\-f\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-\-file\*(Aq options is defined, the resource is created using JSON description from given file\&.
.sp
If \*(Aq\-j\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-\-json\*(Aq options is defined, the resource is created using JSON description read from standard input\&.
.RE
.PP
update ID [\-f FILE|\-\-file FILE|\-j JSON|\-\-json JSON] [\-\-raw]
.RS 4
Updates a resource\&. ID is a resource\*(Aqs identifier and depends on resource\*(Aqs type\&. By default, resource\*(Aqs JSON representation is opened with editor defined by environment variables VISUAL or EDITOR\&. If these variables are not defined, \*(Aqnotepad\&.exe\*(Aq is used on Windows and \*(Aqvi\*(Aq on other systems\&. If opened template is saved, resource is updated using provided data\&. Updated data are then shown\&. \-\-raw option causes the client to print JSON representation of given resource\&.
.sp
If \*(Aq\-f\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-\-file\*(Aq options is defined, user is updated using JSON description from given file\&.
.sp
If \*(Aq\-j\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-\-json\*(Aq options is defined, user is updated using JSON description read from standard input\&.
.RE
.PP
delete ID
.RS 4
Deletes a resource\&. ID is a resource\*(Aqs identifier and depends on resource\*(Aqs type\&.
.RE
.PP
Below, actions for each (sub)resource type are detailed\&.
.SS "files"
.PP
A file is a sub\-resource\&. It is uniquely identified by its name and the identifier of the resource it is part of\&. Therefore, \*(Aqlist\*(Aq and \*(Aqadd\*(Aq take the containing resource identifier as argument where \*(Aqshow\*(Aq, \*(Aqupdate\*(Aq and \*(Aqdelete\*(Aq the file identifier\&.
.PP
Files feature 2 additional actions:
.PP
show\-content ID
.RS 4
Prints the content of the file on standard output\&.
.RE
.PP
set\-content ID PATH
.RS 4
Uploads the content of local file PATH to file identified by ID\&.
.RE
.SS "parameters"
.PP
A parameter is a sub\-resource of platform, distribution and application\&. It is uniquely identified by its name and the identifier of the resource it is part of\&. Therefore, \*(Aqlist\*(Aq and \*(Aqadd\*(Aq take the containing resource identifier as argument where \*(Aqshow\*(Aq, \*(Aqupdate\*(Aq and \*(Aqdelete\*(Aq the file identifier\&.
.SS "settings"
.PP
A setting is a sub\-resource of organization, environment, host, distribution, platform, application context, platform context and distribution context\&. It is uniquely identified by its name and the identifier of the resource it is part of\&. Therefore, \*(Aqlist\*(Aq and \*(Aqadd\*(Aq take the containing resource identifier as argument where \*(Aqshow\*(Aq, \*(Aqupdate\*(Aq and \*(Aqdelete\*(Aq the file identifier\&.
.SS "platforms"
.PP
A platform is uniquely identified by its name and the name of the organization it is part of\&. Therefore, \*(Aqlist\*(Aq and \*(Aqadd\*(Aq take an organization name as argument where \*(Aqshow\*(Aq, \*(Aqupdate\*(Aq and \*(Aqdelete\*(Aq an organization name and a platform name\&.
.PP
Supplementary options are available when adding a platform:
.PP
\*(Aq\-\-default\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-d\*(Aq
.RS 4
if the option is provided, platform\*(Aqs driver configures it i\&.e\&. adds required files and settings\&.
.RE
.PP
\*(Aq\-\-test\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-t\*(Aq
.RS 4
if the option is provided, platform\*(Aqs driver validates given settings\&.
.RE

.PP
import [PATH]
.RS 4
Platform is imported from given folder\&.
.RE
.SS "applications"
.PP
An application is uniquely identified by its name and the name of the organization it is part of\&. Therefore, \*(Aqlist\*(Aq and \*(Aqadd\*(Aq take an organization name as argument where \*(Aqshow\*(Aq, \*(Aqupdate\*(Aq and \*(Aqdelete\*(Aq an organization name and an application name\&.
.PP
An application has 2 sub\-resources:

.RE
.PP

.RE
.SS "flavors"
.PP
A flavor is uniquely identified by its name\&. Therefore \*(Aqlist\*(Aq does not take any argument and \*(Aqshow\*(Aq takes a flavor name\&. As flavors are read\-only resources, \*(Aqadd\*(Aq, \*(Aqupdate\*(Aq and \*(Aqdelete\*(Aq actions are not available\&.
.SS "distributions"
.PP
A distribution is uniquely identified by its name and the name of the organization it is part of\&. Therefore, \*(Aqlist\*(Aq and \*(Aqadd\*(Aq take an organization name as argument where \*(Aqshow\*(Aq, \*(Aqupdate\*(Aq and \*(Aqdelete\*(Aq an organization name and a distribution name\&.
.PP
A supplementary option is available when adding a distribution: \*(Aq\-\-flavor FLAVOR\*(Aq\&. It allows the user to select the flavor of created distribution, letting the server adding default files, parameters and/or settings\&. See \*(Aqflavors\*(Aq resource\&.

.SS "organizations"
.PP
An organization is uniquely identified by its name\&. Therefore, \*(Aqlist\*(Aq and \*(Aqadd\*(Aq take no argument where \*(Aqshow\*(Aq, \*(Aqupdate\*(Aq and \*(Aqdelete\*(Aq take an organization name\&.

.RE
.PP
An organization has user groups that allow to implement a simple access control: members of \*(Aqadmin\*(Aq group have full access on the organization; members of \*(Aqusers\*(Aq group have full access on the resources of the organization\&. In particular, members of \*(Aqusers\*(Aq group cannot add or remove users from the organization but \*(Aqadmin\*(Aq users can\&.
.PP
Group sub\-resource allows to \*(Aqlist\*(Aq, \*(Aqshow\*(Aq and \*(Aqupdate\*(Aq an organization\*(Aqs users groups\&. \*(Aqadd\*(Aq and \*(Aqdelete\*(Aq actions are not yet available\&.
.PP
Organizations feature 3 additional actions:
.PP
export ORG_NAME [PATH] [\-\-force]
