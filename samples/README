This folder contains scripts illustrating the use of cortex-client Python API
and data files associated to these scripts. Below a short description of each
script.

definitions.py
==============

Contains definitions that may be used by below scripts. These definitions
include information about organization, environment, distribution, platform,
application and host to be created/used.

create.py
=========

Creates resources (organization, environment, distribution, platform,
application and host).

provision.py
============

Provisions created host (create.py must have been called first). This script
blocks until host is completely provisioned.

To be able to provision host, a libvirt daemon must run on local host. Initrd
and vmlinuz files must also be available (see definitions.py). Also, pay
attention to distribution's definition (see definitions.py).

delete.py
=========

Deletes all created resources.

create_provision_delete.py
==========================

Is equivalent to the execution of sequence of scripts 'create.py', 'provision.py'
and 'delete.py'.
